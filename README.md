# Sci-Fi-Item-Manager
The idea behind this project is to create a system that will manage items being taken out and put back into our inventory.
# Why Make this
Prior to this, we'd have a **huge** book of logs, that people had to use to write in to do this. Automating the process allows us to better keep track of what's happening, as we'll have better access to critical statistics that would be tedious to try and evaluate using physical logs.
